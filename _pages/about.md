我是[中国海洋大学](https://www.ouc.edu.cn/)的大三学生，对分析方面的数学很感兴趣。
之前非常荣幸得到[张临杰](https://math.ouc.edu.cn/2017/0412/c8925a61425/page.psp)教授的指导，还学习了[刘珑龙]((https://math.ouc.edu.cn/2017/0412/c8925a61352/page.psp))教授的《人工神经网络与深度学习基础》课程。

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons. 

Example: editing a markdown file for a talk
